# Git/GitHub Practice Repo
This repo was created for Datagrove Costa Rica developers to practice making commits, creating branches, and making pull requests.

## About These Instructions
* Items in a `different color` indicate buttons or specific text 
* Items in a code block will be entered into a terminal

        open index.html

* Text in <angle brackets> should be customized to your project - do not type the angle brackets themselves

    For example, if the instructions say:

        git checkout -b <branchName>
    
    You would actually type:

        git checkout -b featureBranch
